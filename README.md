# htmx-haskell-starter (refactored to use web-inv-route)

## Overview

This repo is refactoring of a fork of [htmx-haskell-starter](https://github.com/gubsey/htmx-haskell-starter). 

The aim of the refactor is to explore the Haskell library [web-inv-route](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/web-inv-route) (for type-safe, reversible routes) while experimenting with [htmx](https://htmx.org) for developing lightweight, backend-driven web applications.
